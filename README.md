# Python Modules for R

Python is known for a stellar [module and import system](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html)
that makes it incredibly easy to manage dependencies and track the
etiology of local variables and functions.

This project offers a "port" to R of Python's module system using
[syberia](https://github.com/robertzk/syberia), a development framework for R.
